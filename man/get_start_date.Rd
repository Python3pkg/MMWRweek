\description{
Values for MMWR week range from 1 to 53, although most years consist of
52 weeks. The first day of any MMWR week is Sunday. MMWR week numbering
is sequential beginning with 1 and incrementing with each week to a maximum
of 52 or 53. MMWR week #1 of an MMWR year is the first week of the year
that has at least four days in the calendar year. For example, if January
1 occurs on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, the calendar week that
includes January 1 would be MMWR week #1. If January 1 occurs on a Thursday,
Friday, or Saturday, the calendar week that includes January 1 would be the
last MMWR week of the previous year (#52 or #53). This function returns the
start date for the year associated with this date.
